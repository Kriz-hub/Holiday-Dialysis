# Holiday Dialysis
Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

This project is a one page website about a Dialysis Center in the middle of The Netherlands. They offer a dialysis treatment for people who suffer from kidney failure and are open for guests who are on holiday. This is a made up center in the small city of Harderwijk, but actually I work in a real dialysis center in that place.That is a satelite center of the big one in Amersfoort, 30km from Harderwijk.


## UX
From a financial point of view it is for a hospital very interesting to add guests to their patient population. A descent website helps to develop a good image.
I know there is a real demand of a good website for the dialysis center, first one for holiday guests, later for the dialysys center as a whole.
To prevent that the Milestone 1 project will be too big, I make the part that make the attention for guests.

Business goals:
To get guests interested for there center, there are more to choose in a radius of 50 km. It's a tourist area, that also means the foriegn guest.
The website must not be for a too young audience, the poultation is 40 years and older
To create goodwill.

Customer goals:
The kidney patient needs 3 times a week dialysis in his own center, but also wants to have an opportunity to get on holiday.
He needs to be informed which center he can choose and what the can offer him.

So the website must be informing but not too corporate. He is in the mood for holiday and that mood shoot reflect the website.
